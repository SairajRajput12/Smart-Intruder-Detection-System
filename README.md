# Intruder Detection with OpenCV

## Overview

This project utilizes OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to detect intruders in a given environment. By analyzing video feeds or images, the system identifies potential intruders based on predefined criteria such as motion detection, facial recognition, or object detection.

## Features

- **Motion Detection**: Utilizes motion detection algorithms to identify any movement within the surveillance area.
- **Facial Recognition**: Recognizes faces of known individuals and alerts on the presence of unrecognized individuals.
- **Object Detection**: Detects specific objects or entities relevant to security concerns (e.g., weapons, unauthorized items).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
- Additional libraries as necessary (e.g., NumPy, matplotlib)
